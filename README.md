# vscode-lithia

Adds basic support for the [Lithia programming language](https://github.com/vknabel/lithia) for Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

Requires lithia to be [installed](https://github.com/vknabel/lithia#installation).
By default `lithia.path` is set to `["/usr/bin/env", "lithia"]` and should work on most setups.

If not, set `lithia.path` to the correct, absolute path like `/usr/local/bin/lithia` or to a command as above.

## Status

The language support currrently is in an eary, experimental state. Only a few features have rudimentarily been implemented.

## License

vscode-lithia is available under the [MIT](./LICENSE) license.
